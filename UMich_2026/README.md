## Data Processing 🧹

- This data is already precleand by the organizer and I also re-check.

### Merge dataset 1 and dataset 2

```py
state_merge = df1.merge(df2,
                                          left_on=['State', 'Year','Quarter'],
                                          right_on=['State', 'Year','Quarter'],
                                          how='left')
```

### Metrics configuration

```py
# Define what metrics you want to analyze and how to display them
METRICS = {
    'Total_Tax_Revenue': {
        'column': 'Amount',
        'aggregation': 'sum',
        'title': 'Total Tax Revenue',
        'ylabel': 'Tax Revenue ($)',
        'format': lambda x, p: f'${x/1e9:.1f}B' if x >= 1e9 else f'${x/1e6:.0f}M'
    },
    'GDP_Total': {
        'column': 'GDP_Total',
        'aggregation': 'sum',
        'title': 'GDP Total',
        'ylabel': 'GDP ($)',
        'format': lambda x, p: f'${x/1e9:.1f}B' if x >= 1e9 else f'${x/1e6:.0f}M'
    },
    'Total Civilian Labor Force': {
        'column': 'Total Civilian Labor Force',
        'aggregation': 'sum',
        'title': 'Total Civilian Labor Force',
        'ylabel': 'Total Civilian Labor Force',
        'format': lambda x, p: f'{x:,.0f}',  # Format with commas, no decimals
    }
}
```

### Calculate metrics by year 📆

```py
def calculate_metric_by_year(df, states, metric_name, year_range=(2014, 2024)):
    """
    Calculate any metric by state and year

    Parameters:
    -----------
    df : DataFrame
        The main dataframe
    states : list
        List of states to include
    metric_name : str
        Name of the metric from METRICS dictionary
    year_range : tuple
        (start_year, end_year)

    Returns:
    --------
    DataFrame with columns: State, Year, {metric_name}
    """
    if metric_name not in METRICS:
        raise ValueError(f"Metric '{metric_name}' not found. Available: {list(METRICS.keys())}")

    metric_config = METRICS[metric_name]
    column = metric_config['column']
    aggregation = metric_config['aggregation']

    # Filter for year range
    df_filtered = df[(df['Year'] >= year_range[0]) & (df['Year'] <= year_range[1])].copy()

    # Special handling for GDP Per Capita (calculated metric)
    if metric_name == 'GDP_Per_Capita':
        # Calculate GDP per capita = GDP_Total / Population
        # First get averages of GDP and Population by State and Year
        gdp_avg = df_filtered.groupby(['State', 'Year'])['GDP_Total'].mean().reset_index()
        pop_avg = df_filtered.groupby(['State', 'Year'])['Population'].mean().reset_index()

        # Merge and calculate per capita
        result = gdp_avg.merge(pop_avg, on=['State', 'Year'])
        result['GDP_Per_Capita'] = (result['GDP_Total'] * 1_000_000) / result['Population']  # GDP is in millions, so multiply by 1M
        result = result[['State', 'Year', 'GDP_Per_Capita']]
        result.columns = ['State', 'Year', metric_name]
    else:
        # Group by State and Year
        if aggregation == 'sum':
            result = df_filtered.groupby(['State', 'Year'])[column].sum().reset_index()
        elif aggregation == 'mean':
            result = df_filtered.groupby(['State', 'Year'])[column].mean().reset_index()
        elif aggregation == 'median':
            result = df_filtered.groupby(['State', 'Year'])[column].median().reset_index()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown aggregation: {aggregation}")

        result.columns = ['State', 'Year', metric_name]

    # Filter for our states of interest
    result = result[result['State'].isin(states)]

    return result
```
## Background information
- Tax haven states are states with personal income tax smaller than 1%. (According to the Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, the Professor of Law from University of Michigan)
- Over the past decade, these states have attracted attention for their relatively strong economic performance, including higher GDP per capita and growing labor forces.
- In January 2025, New Hampshire eliminated its personal income tax. (According to NH Business Review)

This makes it unclear whether the economic benefits come from having low taxes, or from special conditions unique to that state. Because of that, it’s uncertain whether other states would see the same growth if they eliminated their income tax. (According to Urban Institute)

## Key Findings

### High Severance Tax Revenue
![Word Cloud](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/Datathon/blob/main/UMich_2026/viz/Screen%20Shot%202026-02-15%20at%2017.00.16.png)
- Tax haven states earn higher severance tax (*) revenue than their normal peers, more than $120k/year on average.
(*) Severance Taxes. Taxes on the "severing" of natural resources (oil, gas, timber).


### GDP Per Capita
![Line Graph](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/Datathon/blob/main/UMich_2026/viz/Screen%20Shot%202026-02-15%20at%2017.00.29.png)
- Based on the economic dataset provided, accounting for all states classified as either tax haven* or non-haven, the tax haven states performed better per capita in mean GDP.
- Tax haven and non-haven states evened out during Covid (2020) but the data shows that tax haven states convincingly outpaced other states and are projected to continue to do better based on a linear regression forecast.


### Impact on Labor Force
![Emotional content](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/Datathon/blob/main/UMich_2026/viz/Screen%20Shot%202026-02-15%20at%2017.00.36.png)
- The labor force grows much stronger in tax haven states than non-haven states. Based  on the dataset, in the 20 years recorded, tax haven states increased by 1 million while non-haven states increased by around 250k. 
- Being a tax haven creates a need for specialized sectors which show more resilience in hiring for specialized labor. It attracts the working population, growing the workforce and increasing the need for essential services.

### Limitations: Tax-haven states can make low income families pay higher overall tax rates
![Emotional content](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/Datathon/blob/main/UMich_2026/viz/Screen%20Shot%202026-02-15%20at%2017.00.49.png)

- Tax-haven states are likely to have higher sales & excise taxes.
- Highest sales & excise taxes states can cause low income families pay higher overall tax rates.
- In the chart above, 6 of the 10 states that depend most on sales and excise taxes are tax havens.

## Recommendations
Stakeholders: State Governments and Policy Makers
→ Based on the historical data, tax havens tend to have:
Increase GDP per Capita
Increasing labor force
Increase severance tax revenue
→ The goal of tax havens
Offset reductions in income tax revenue by increasing alternative sources, such as:
+ Sales tax (e.g., Arizona)
+ Natural resource taxes (e.g., North Dakota)

The cost-of-living is not available in our dataset, so we recommend further research on this problem.
